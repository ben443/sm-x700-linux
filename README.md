Mainline Linux runs **usably** on the Galaxy Tab S8+ Wi-Fi (`gts8pwifi`, Qualcomm
SM8450 "Waipio"): vanilla kernel 7.2, all 8 cores, a **native KMS display driver**
(our S6TUUM1 panel driver — DSC, 120 Hz, real power management) on the 2800×1752
OLED, root on UFS, **WiFi with ssh**, **Bluetooth**, **touchscreen**, and the
**Book Cover Keyboard** — you can log in at the panel and type on the real
keyboard, or ssh in over WLAN with no cables at all.

No Galaxy Tab S8 port exists upstream — as far as we can tell this is the first.

The repository also carries a separate **SM-X700 / `gts8wifi`** variant. It has
its own device package, uniLoader board profile, device tree, and pinned 6.13
kernel build; it does not reuse the X800 panel configuration. That variant is
based on the community port at
[kubierend/sm-x700-linux](https://github.com/kubierend/sm-x700-linux) and has
not been tested on hardware by this project. Read
[`docs/14-gts8wifi-variant.md`](docs/14-gts8wifi-variant.md) before building or
flashing it.

| Component | State |
|---|---|
| Boot (uniLoader → mainline kernel) | ✅ working. uniLoader pinned with four patches: DTB relocation, the kernel command line from an embedded blob (`/proc/cmdline` ends in `bootloader=uniloader`), board registration, and aligned memcpy for the MMU-off CPU state ABL hands over (fixed the 2026-09-22 reset loop). Build and flash are one ordered `make` sequence. Story: docs/05 |
| Display — native KMS console (msm DPU/DSI/DSC @ 2800×1752) | ✅ working |
| CPU — all 8 cores | ✅ working |
| UFS storage — root mounted, auto-resized | ✅ working |
| Touchscreen (STM FTS1BA90A) | ✅ working — our `fts1ba90a` driver, orientation measured on-device |
| Book Cover Keyboard (pogo STM32 @ i2c 0x2a) | ✅ working — our `stm32-pogo` driver (keyboard, caps LED; touchpad supported but untested, the Slim cover has none) |
| WiFi (WCN6855, ath11k on PCIe0) | ✅ working — NetworkManager autoconnects at boot; primary ssh path. Carries the upstream RX-corruption fix trilogy (bulk downloads used to wedge with `msdu_done` errors / silent drops) |
| Bluetooth (WCN6855 on uart20) | ✅ controller up, address from efs, scan finds devices; pairing pending |
| USB-C port: Type-C, PD, roles (MAX77705 CCIC) | ✅ working — our `max77705-usbc` driver speaks to the CCIC's PD firmware through its mailbox (ADR-003): plug a device and the tablet becomes host and switches VBUS on, unplug and VBUS goes off; plug a PC or charger and it becomes device and sink; a PD-passthrough dongle can swap roles live. Safety rules live in the driver: an opcode and register allowlist, fixed PDOs only, at most 9 V and 15 W, input limit lowered before any voltage increase (kernel r40). Story: ADR-003, PR #59 |
| USB host (xhci) | ✅ working — hot-plug with VBUS by attach: mice, keyboards, RTL8153 ethernet (firmware packaged), in either cable orientation |
| USB gadget (to a PC) | ✅ working — plug into a computer and it enumerates as "Galaxy Tab S8+": NCM ethernet (the PC gets 172.16.42.2 by DHCP, ssh to 172.16.42.1), a serial login on `/dev/ttyACM*`, and MTP, so KDE's device notifier offers "Open with File Manager" on the tablet's `~/Shared` folder (a dedicated folder: MTP has no authentication, so the home directory with its dot-files stays off the cable) (device r30) |
| Charging and battery | ✅ working — upstream MAX77705 charger and gauge drivers (with our fixes): `/sys/class/power_supply/max170xx_battery` reports capacity, voltage, current, temperature and cycles; charging at 9 V PD from chargers and PC ports. Deliberately below stock (4.30 V float, 2.0 A) because mainline does not do stock's temperature-dependent charging; stock parity waits on a thermal guard (kernel r36). Story: ADR-003, PR #56 |
| Power key, volume down (PMIC PON) | ✅ working |
| Volume up (pm8350 gpio6, gpio-keys) | 🟡 mapped and working on most boots — `KEY_VOLUMEUP` from the pm8350 GPIO line, active low with pull-up, as stock wires it. On some boots the PMIC latches two edges per press while the level never changes, so no event fires until the next reboot (issue #18; `tools/volup-trap/` records the next occurrence) |
| `reboot download` from Linux | 🟡 PON `mode-download` wired but ABL ignores it — likely cold reset clears the spare bits (downstream forces a warm reset first); under investigation |
| Native panel driver (S6TUUM1 DDIC) | ✅ working — full native KMS: cold init (Anapass TCON-ready handshake), DSC @ 2800×1752, TE-synced 120 Hz, DPMS blank/unblank, brightness (11-bit DBV). Leaving the panel DPMS off hangs the tablet about a minute later with a silent reset, so idle blanking ships as `console-blank` (device r26): black frame after `BLANK_MIN` idle minutes with the panel powered, wake on any input; device r27 rescans `/dev/input` when the node count changes, so late and hot-plugged devices wake it too. Story: docs/08-native-display.md, device-facts/display-s6tuum1.md |
| S Pen (Wacom WEZ01 EMR digitizer) | ✅ working — our `wacom-wez01` driver; position + pressure + tool. SE14's FIFO is silicon-disabled (forces broken GPI DMA), so we bit-bang i2c on its pins via `i2c-gpio`. Firmware `wez01_gts8p.bin` (harvested). Polish: query/calibration + axis verify. Story: device-facts/wacom-wez01.md |
| GPU (Adreno 730) | ✅ working — freedreno/Mesa `FD730`, OpenGL ES 3.2; Samsung-signed zap from the `apnhlos` partition (`gts8pwifi-fw-extract`), firmware rides in the initramfs (a7xx loads SQE at bind time) |
| Plasma Desktop 6 (KWin Wayland) | ✅ working — full KDE 6.7 desktop, KWin composited on the Adreno, Plasma Login Manager autostart; one command on a fresh install: `sudo gts8pwifi-setup plasma`. Polish gaps: tear bands under fast motion (panel idles at ~24 Hz LFD), no runtime 120 Hz switching yet |
| Login experience | ✅ quiet boot (`loglevel=4`), generated `/etc/issue` banner with live IP (agetty needs `--issue-file` on Alpine), UTF-8 locale, keyboard autorepeat (kernel r42) |
| Audio | ✅ working — four CS35L45 amps on Primary MI2S from the ADSP (AudioReach), stereo playback through PulseAudio/UCM; volume capped (no speaker-protection DSP yet). Three DMICs through the VA macro, powered from L12C (found 2026-09-21 with a pad probe); stereo capture of the bottom and back mics through UCM. Story: docs/10-audio.md |
| Rear flash LED | ✅ working — PM8350C flash module, two channels as one white LED at `/sys/class/leds/white:flash` (kernel r12). Torch: `brightness` 0..255 for 0..500 mA total, stock's level is 77 (150 mA). Flash: `flash_brightness` up to 1.5 A, hardware timeout up to 1280 ms, fired with `flash_strobe`; the timer ends the pulse and `flash_fault` then reads `flash-timeout-exceeded`, which is the normal end of a strobe |
| Cameras | 🟡 all three sensors stream RAW10 at 30 fps, session after session — mainline CAMSS on SM8450, the Hi847 driver converted to device tree, a new Hi1337 driver with tables from the stock configuration, and a camcc fix that parks the camera RCGs on XO when idle (kernel r25). `tools/camtest.sh uw|front|frontfull|rear` captures 3264x2448, 2032x1524 / 4000x3000 and 4128x3096; first frames in `docs/media/camera-*-first-frame.jpg`. The DW9808 lens on GENI i2c2 focuses the rear camera through `focus_absolute` and the module EEPROM reads at nvmem (kernel r29, `tools/lens-test.sh`); libcamera is next (ADR-001, issue #27). Story: docs/11-camera.md |
| Sensors (incl. auto-rotate) | 🟡 accelerometer, light and magnetometer through the SLPI with hexagonrpcd (patched) and libssc, iio-sensor-proxy reports orientation and auto-rotate has what it needs (kernel r28, device r24, the served tree built from the tablet's own vendor partition at setup); gyroscope and calibration open. Story: docs/12-sensors.md, issue #33 |
| Hall switches, thermistors | ✅ both hall switches work, level and interrupt, as EV_SW on gpio-keys: cover on tlmm 169 at the left edge about midway, S Pen on tlmm 23 at the upper right corner of the back face, located with a magnet and `gpiomon` on 2026-09-22. The Book Cover Keyboard folio never brings a magnet to the cover sensor; tlmm 23 reads asserted while the folio is attached but off the pogo pins and while the pen is in the folio holder. AP and Wi-Fi thermistors on the pmk8350 ADC (kernel r26), `gts8pwifi-therm` prints stock-table temperatures. Story: docs/13-buttons-and-lid.md, issue #33 |
| Lid, pen and power button (`folio-state` daemon, `console-blank`) | ✅ working with nobody logged in. `foliod` fuses the pogo keyboard device, the two hall switches and a magnetometer sample through the SLPI into `SW_LID` and `SW_PEN_INSERTED` on a virtual input device; `console-blank` reads it (device r27): close the folio and the console goes dark in about 5 s, open it and it is back in about 3 s, the power button toggles the console with the lid open and does nothing closed, logind ignores the lid. Pen-forgotten logging is off by default because the pen in the folio holder is invisible to the sensors. Suspend and resume turned out to work (issue #49); lid to suspend is a future ADR amendment. Story: docs/13-buttons-and-lid.md, ADR-002, PR #48 |

### Getting a shell

**Local:** attach the Book Cover Keyboard and log in at the panel like any laptop.

**Wireless:** the device autoconnects to its saved WiFi network at boot
(NetworkManager profile) and a bring-up service prints interface/MAC/IP/gateway to
the panel whenever they change — read the address off the screen and ssh to it.

**USB cable:** plug the tablet into a computer. The computer gets 172.16.42.2 by
DHCP; `ssh user@172.16.42.1`, or open the serial console on `/dev/ttyACM0`. The
file manager sees the tablet over MTP (this capture predates the switch from the
home directory to `~/Shared`):

![Dolphin browsing the tablet over MTP](docs/media/usb-mtp-dolphin.png)

**Fallback:** a USB-C ethernet dongle works the same way, and
holding **volume-down from initial power-on** drops into the postmarketOS initramfs
debug shell (on-screen keyboard via osk-sdl).

## Should you try this?

If "mainline Linux with a real GPU on Samsung tablet hardware" makes you grin,
genuinely: yes, come on in — the water's weird but warm. Read this first, though,
because the door locks behind you:

- **Unlocking the bootloader permanently blows the Knox efuse.** Warranty gone,
  Knox/Samsung Pay features dead forever — even if you return to stock Android.
  There is no un-blowing it.
- **Going back to stock is possible but not painless.** Odin can reflash Samsung
  firmware (`make restore-android` documents our path), but expect friction, and
  Knox stays tripped regardless.
- **The unlock/root path has a firmware ceiling.** Bootloader binary 9 or lower
  qualifies (the fifth character from the end of the build number, e.g. `X800XXU9DYDC`).
  Binary 9 covers One UI 7 and the first One UI 8 builds up to January 2026;
  binary A or B, shipped since February 2026, closes the door. Which units still
  qualify, and how to downgrade to One UI 7 first: `docs/00-compatibility.md`.
- **This is a development platform, not a product.** No microphones, raw
  camera frames only, motion sensors through the SLPI with a patched daemon. What works, works
  genuinely well — native display, GPU, input, wireless — but you are signing up to be a porter,
  not a customer.

And a sincere off-ramp: if any of the above reads as risk rather than fun,
**Samsung DeX plus a Linux terminal/emulator app gets you a capable Linux
environment with zero risk and zero soldered-shut doors.** That is the sensible
choice. This repo is the other one.

Start with `docs/00` (does your tablet qualify), then `docs/01` (unlock/root), then `docs/05` (the boot recipe).

## Why this is unusual

You **cannot** boot mainline Linux directly from Samsung's bootloader on this SoC.
Samsung's ABL merges its own device-tree overlay fragments onto whatever DTB it
selects, which corrupts a mainline device tree — the kernel then dies before any
console exists, giving you a completely silent failure.

The fix is [**uniLoader**](https://github.com/ivoszbg/uniLoader), a secondary
bootloader that embeds the kernel, DTB and ramdisk inside its own binary and
masquerades as a kernel image. Samsung's ABL only ever sees "a kernel" and never
touches our device tree. (`lk2nd` does not support SM8450.)

The full story — including the seven separate silent failures it took to get a
console — is in [`docs/05-mainline-uniloader-boot.md`](docs/05-mainline-uniloader-boot.md).
If you are porting another Samsung SM8450 device, read that first; it will save you
a lot of blind reboots.

                          (make help lists it)
```

Not in git (see `.gitignore`): `pmb-work/`, `kernel-src/`, `reference/`,
`root-build/`, and all Samsung firmware (stock partition dumps, stock DTBs). Those
are Samsung's copyrighted binaries and stay local.

## Building

Requires [pmbootstrap](https://postmarketos.org/pmbootstrap), `odin4`,
`android-tools` (mkbootimg/unpack_bootimg/img2simg), and `dtc`.

First run only — point the vendored pmbootstrap at this repo and device
(everything lives under the repo; nothing touches your home directory except
pmbootstrap's own config file):

```sh
./pmb init      # work path: <this repo>/pmb-work
                # channel edge, device samsung-gts8pwifi (ours), UI console
```

The build is an ordered sequence. Each step checks what the previous one left
behind and names the step to run when something is missing:

```sh
make check          # host tools, pmbootstrap init, dumps, harvest, apks; ends with
                    # what you are ready for (boot/install-tablet, or image once
                    # rootfs has produced root-build/combined.img)
make deps           # one-time: clone uniLoader (pinned), copy in the board port,
                    # apply patches 0001-0004, install the chroot toolchain
make dumps          # verify the stock partition dumps; ADB=1 pulls boot, apnhlos
                    # and super from a tablet rooted on stock (docs/01 step 8)
make harvest        # copy the proprietary blobs (GPU zap, sensor registry) out of the dumps
make rootfs         # pmb install; preserves the combined image, prints the UUIDs
make image          # uuids gate -> kernel -> device -> boot -> sparse userdata tar
make flash-all      # first install: boot + userdata in ONE odin session
make install-tablet # later kernels: dd boot.img + apk add over ssh, then reboot
make help           # the same list, plus every other target
```

Variants: `make boot-debug` builds a second boot image with `pmos.debug-shell`
on the command line (its own `boot-debug.img` and tar, the normal artifacts stay);
`make kernel`, `make device` and `make boot` run one stage of `image`;
`make flash-help` picks the odin flavor for what you changed.

`make rootfs` prompts for the device user password unless you pass
`PASSWORD=...` (the docs use throwaway credentials throughout — pick your own).
`DEVSUDO=1` additionally installs the `-devsudo` subpackage: passwordless sudo
for the default user, for development images only.

uniLoader owns the kernel command line. The `cmdline-blob` step writes
`blob/cmdline` from `pmaports-overlay/uniloader-port/cmdline.in` with the two
rootfs UUIDs read from the vendor_boot header, then appends
`bootloader=uniloader` and anything in `BOOTARGS_EXTRA`; uniLoader sets
`/chosen/bootargs` from it at boot. The DTS still carries the same tokens for
now, so `make image` starts with the `uuids` gate: the rootfs UUIDs must match
the DTS or the build stops and prints the two lines to change. The `uuids` gate
stays until the DTS copy is dropped (kernel pkgrel 29). A mismatch there was the
most common cause of the initramfs debug shell while the DTS supplied the
command line, and today the blob already carries the rootfs values.

`make uniloader` picks the kernel apk by the APKBUILD's `pkgver-pkgrel`, never
the newest file, and records it in `.stage/kernel-apk`; `install-tablet`
refuses when that record does not match the APKBUILD. The boot-image build runs
`stage-fw` first (stages the harvested GPU zap into the build chroot's initramfs
and hard-fails if it does not land) and ends by printing the numbered bring-up
manifest.

## Flashing gotchas

These cost us many cycles — see `docs/05` §5:

- **The device must be in a freshly entered download mode.** A session that has sat
  through boot attempts fails with `FAIL! (Auth)`, and the *"an error has occurred
  while updating the device software"* screen is a "fake download mode": it
  enumerates as `04e8:685d` and `odin4 -l` finds it, but it will not accept a
  flash. Entry choreography and recovery details: `docs/05` §5.
- **userdata must be a sparse image** (`img2simg`). A raw ext4 image fails at ~3%
  with `Fail request receive 3`.
- **userdata must hold the *combined* image**, i.e. `pmb install` *without*
  `--split`. The pmOS initramfs needs both a `pmOS_boot` and a `pmOS_root`
  subpartition, and our real boot partition is occupied by uniLoader — so both have
  to live inside userdata. Flashing only the split `-root.img` leaves no `pmOS_boot`
  and stage-1 stalls forever in `wait_boot_partition`. See `docs/05` §8b.
- **The "press power button to confirm unverified firmware boot" prompt times out
  on its own** and the boot continues unattended; pressing Power only skips the wait.
- **A flash is two things: the boot image and the kernel apk.** Kernel modules
  live in the rootfs, not in boot.img. `dd` of the new boot.img replaces kernel,
  DTB and initramfs only; `/lib/modules` is whatever kernel apk the rootfs has
  installed. A patch that changes a module (camss, r13) needs the matching
  `apk add --allow-untrusted linux-postmarketos-qcom-sm8450-7.2-rN.apk` on the
  tablet as well, or the old `.ko` stays and the new compatible never binds.
  `make install-tablet` does both and refuses on a pkgrel mismatch.
- **The UFS LUN order is not stable across boots.** The boot partition was
  `/dev/sda25` on one boot and `/dev/sdb25` on the next. Always address
  `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/boot`, never a hardcoded `sdX`; the tell is `cmp`
  failing against every image at once.
- **Stage the recovery image before the first flash of a new bootloader.** Keep
  a `pmos_uniloader_boot.tar` from a known-good build. `make boot` and
  `make image` rewrite `root-build/pmos_uniloader_boot.tar` and
  `root-build/uniloader/boot.img` in place, so copy the known-good pair aside
  under a dated or pkgrel-suffixed name before rebuilding, for example
  `pmos_uniloader_boot-r28-good.tar`. If the new one loops, enter download mode
  (power off, then Vol Up + Vol Down, plug USB) and `odin4 -a` that saved tar.
- **A camera register touched without its clock hangs the SoC.** Skipping the CPAS
  fast AHB or the VFE core clock in a power-cycle bisect froze the tablet (no ping)
  the moment a VFE register or its interrupt handler ran. Recovery is the Vol Down
  + Power reset. Reading camcc (0xade0000) is safe; the camera blocks under
  TITAN_TOP are not while their domain or clock is off.
- **Do not poll `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio`.** The listing walks every pin controller,
  including the LPASS island one at 0x3440000. A 5 Hz poll of it for a minute ended
  in a silent hang on 2026-09-22 (journal stops mid-session, no crash record); the
  link is a suspicion, not a proof, but `/proc/interrupts` and `evtest` give the
  same answers safely.
- **Flash multiple partitions in one `odin4` invocation** (`-a` and `-u` together,
  as `make flash-all` does) rather than calling odin twice — that is what caused the
  reboot between writes. `--reboot` is opt-in, and `--redownload` returns the device
  to download mode for the next round.

Only `boot`, `vendor_boot`, `dtbo`, `vbmeta` and `userdata` are ever written.
**Never** flash bootloader or secure-world partitions (`xbl`, `aop`, `tz`, `abl`,
`pmic`, …) — Samsung download mode is the only recovery floor on this device
(EDL/9008 is not viable: it needs a Samsung-signed SM8450 Firehose loader that is
not publicly available).

Issues and PRs welcome — especially [device variant reports](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/variant_report.md)
from the rest of the Tab S8 family (same SoC). House style: one variable per
flash, patches via `tools/mkpatch` (never hand-written), evidence over theory —
see `docs/06-upstreaming.md` for the conventions.
